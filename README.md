# The Odin Project - Project: Recipes

This is a project done for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) that tests a person's ability to create basic HTML websites. 

With this project, you will see a demonstration of basic understanding of links, images, lists, and different ways to put in text, such as headers and paragraphs.

You will find a very basic homepage with links to three recipes: French fries, castella cake, and oatmeal raisin cookies. Each of these recipe pages contains an image, a link to the recipe it is based off of, a list of ingredients, and finally a list of steps that you need to go through to make this food item.

Thank you for checking out this project!
