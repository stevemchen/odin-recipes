    <p>The following ingredients and recipe are rephrased from <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/castella/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Just One Cookbook</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100g bread flour</li>
        <li>3 large, room-temp eggs</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp water</li>
        <li>100g sugar</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp honey</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp mizuame</li>
        <li>&frac12; Tbsp white sparkling sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
        <li>Line your baking pan with parchment paper. You may need to refer to the recipe page for detailed instructions on lining the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine your water and honey into a bowl, then add your mizuame. Mash the mizuame to help with the dissolving.</li>
        <li>Sift your bread flour.</li>
        <li>Crack your eggs into a large mixing bowl and add your sugar.</li>
        <li>Use your mixer and beat the eggs and sugar on high. If you use a stand mixer, aim for 3-5 minutes. If you use a hand mixer, aim for longer. Mix until the mixture falls in ribbons.</li>
        <li>Start gradually adding the honey mixture to the batter whilst on low mixing. Do this until all combined.</li>
        <li>Maintain low mixing speed and gradually add the bread flour. As soon as the flour is combined, stop the whisking.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, gently fold the batter several times.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle your white sparkling sugar on the bottom of your baking pan for a crunchy texture. This also helps retain moisture.</li>
        <li>Pour your batter into the baking pan. Try to minimize air pockets by pouring in one single spot. To further reduce air pockets, drop the cake pan onto the counter and draw a zigzag line through the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake the cake for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Complete the following steps &lpar;14-16&rpar; in ideally one minute.</li>
        <li>Open the oven door and spray two sprays of water above the cake batter with a spray bottle.</li>
        <li>Use a spatula to mix the batter 15 times from the left without touching the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Do the same from the right side.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 12 to 16 three more times.</li>
        <li>After your final time, spray water into the oven and bake for another 30-40 minutes.</li>
        <li>If the cake bounces back when you touch it, it is done baking.</li>
        <li>Remove it from the oven, drop the pan twice onto the countertop to release steam, and invert the cake onto a surface &lpar;cookbook recommends silicone mat&rpar;. Let cool for 45-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once cool, wrap the castella cake and parchment paper with plastic wrap and store overnight in the fridge for 8 to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Once stored, you can cut all the edges off for presentation. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
