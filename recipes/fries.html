    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French fries are potatoes cut up, dried, and then deep-fried in oil. This is typically done in a deep fryer. They can also be oven-baked or air-fried, but are most commonly served with traditional deep frying.</p>
    <p>French fries are often made with russet potatoes. There are many variations on the classic dish, such as steak fries and curly fries, but most of these vary only slightly from this delicious treat.</p>

        <li>Oil for frying</li>
